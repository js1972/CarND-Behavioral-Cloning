# CarND-Behavioral-Cloning
Behavioural learning project for Udacity's self-driving car nanodegree program.

## Data
Initially I am using the provided dataset as I do not have a joystick to generate reliable data with the driving simulator.


## Model
<describe model here>


## Notes
Initially I used a model from the Keras Traffic Signs lab as a base. With pre-processing I started out switching the images to grayscale thinking it would be easier for the model to train on - but in hindsight I believe this removed valuable information for the convolutional layers to use so I switched back to colour images.
